### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twentyfirst** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **enum4linux** [here](https://cirt.net/enum4linux2).

or at the GitHub [here](https://github.com/sullo/enum4linux)

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the enum4linux tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my sample website, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is enum4linux?**

enum4linux is a tool used by developers and penetration testers for finding vulnerabilities in web servers. 

enum4linux is described on its GitHub as a web server scanner that tests against "multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software." [enum4linux Website](https://github.com/sullo/enum4linux/wiki/Overview-&-Description#:~:text=for%20multiple%20items,servers%20and%20software.)

### 4. **Why use enum4linux?**

As a developer, you could use enum4linux as one of your many tools for testing your web presence for vulnerabilities. 

As a penetration tester, you could use enum4linux to find vulnerabilities that may be potential exploit points for your team.

### 5. **How to use enum4linux?**

I have set up the Metasploitable 2 DVWA server to mimic a vulnerable web server.

    Step 1:
    You can read the help menu for enum4linux by typing:

    enum4linux -Help

<br>

    Step 2:
    For this exercise, I ran enum4linux using default settings against the 
    Metasploitable 2 server. I used the following command:

    enum4linux -host 192.168.175.128

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/enum4linux/enum4linux1.PNG)

As you can see from the results enum4linux found 27 points of interest against the Metasploitable 2 web server.

Some points of vulnerability would likely be the Apache 2.2.8 version. Additionally, enum4linux found that the web server likely has PHP vulnerabilities as well as cross-site scripting potential. 

### 6. **Summary**

enum4linux is a great tool to add to a developer or penetration testers kit for scanning a web server for vulnerabilities. 

enum4linux found some cross-site scripting potential, as well as a vulnerable Apache version, and vulnerable PHP code running on the webserver. All of these vulnerabilities have current exploits that work against them, so they may be considered a higher risk in most environments. 

Hopefully, you can add enum4linux to your vulnerability testing and use it to find issues that were not known.
