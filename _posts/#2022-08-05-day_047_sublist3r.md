### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **forty-seventh** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **Sublist3r** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r).

Sublist3r was created by Ahmed Aboul-Ela find him on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedaboulela/).


---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Sublist3r tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is Sublist3r?**

Sublist3r is an OSINT tool used to enumerate subdomains. Sublist3r uses a few different search engines to discovery subdomains on your behalf. 

---

### 4. **Why use Sublist3r?**

During the OSINT gathering aspect of penetration testing an analyst may gather all possible subdomains of an organization. Since Sublist3r uses search engines for discovering subdomains this is considered a passive OSINT reconnaissance.

### 5. **How to use Sublist3r?**

In order to use Sublist3r you must have the dependency python3-pip installed to install Sublist3r, find instructions on installing pip [here](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-pip-on-kali-linux).

You must have a VirusTotal API key which can be found [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey).

you will need to download a forked and fixed version of the pythong file ins tep 

    Step 1:
    Install Sublist3r by entering the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git && cd Sublist3r && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This command will clone the GitHub repository where Sublist3r resides, change the directory into that cloned repository and install Sublist3r.

**Note:** The current version of Sublist3r searches VirusTotal, in order for this function to work we need to download a fixed version of the python script and add the VirusTotal API to our environment when running sublist3r.

    Step 2:
    In the directory from step 1 enter the following 
    command in your terminal:

`rm -rf sublist3r.py && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r/3cb826c2f36f4972dfd286c704efc07de3a7f94c/sublist3r.py && chmod +x sublist3r.py`

This should have downloaded a new version of sublist3r.py while also removing the old version and giving the new version executable permissions.

    Enter the following command to export the virus total API key:

    export VT_APIKEY=YOUR_CUSTOM_API_KEY_HERE

**Note:** currently you need to export the Virus Total API key before running Sublist3r in a new terminal window. You can add the API key to your bash script by following the advice found [here](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r/issues/194#:~:text=inside%20the%20sublist3r-,crahan,on%20Nov%2029%2C%202020,-I%20use%20the).

### 6. **Summary**

Sublist3r is a useful OSINT tool for discovering Subdomains of an organization. Penetration testers may use Sublist3r when finding avenues of approach for reconnaissance and future attack.
