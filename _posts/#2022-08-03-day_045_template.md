### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **forty-fifth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **Maigret** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/soxoj/maigret).

Maigret was created by a user named Soxoj, find Soxoj [here](https://github.com/soxoj).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Maigret tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is Maigret?**

Maigret is similar to the tool Blackbird from my post on day 36 which can be found [here](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/day_036_blackbird/).

Basically Maigret searches up to 2500 sites for a username, compiles the found information and can output it in many formats, such as PDF.

### 4. **Why use Maigret?**

As a penetration tester it is important to leverage all avenues of approach that may lead to entry into a network during testing. Using Maigret can help a Penetration tester find information about employees at the organization which may provide additional information.
