### 3. **What is Photon?**

We have talked about Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) in the past. Remember it is information that is easily available to anyone (if they know how ot find it).

Photon is an OSINT tool for crawling websites. Crawling is automatically accessing a website and obtaining data from it. Photon crawls a website looking for URL's, emails, social accounts, files, keys, JavaScript, and custom search patterns you create.

### 4. **Why use Photon?**

As a penetration tester Photon allows you to find many of the endpoints on a website as well as finds data that may be used in initial footholds such as emails and social media accounts to target during a social engineering attack.

As an investigator it is beneficial to find as much open-soruce intelligence as possible to gather evidence for your investigation.

Photon outputs all the URL's to the data found into easy to read .txt files or you can choose to output the data in a CSV or JSON format as well. 

### 5. **How to use Photon?**

Photon is very easy to use and comes with a help page like maany other tools.
