### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-ninth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Today will be a lighter post and involve a resource that can supplement many of the tools we have covered as well as many tools you may use. 

Find **SecLists** [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/).

SecLists is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddiz and g0tmi1k on GitHub.

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the SecLists tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is SecLists?**

SecLists is a repository of lists used during directory discovery, web fuzzing, password spraying, web testing, URL discovery, username discovery, password discovery and many other uses. 

---

### 4. **Why use SecLists?**

SecLists is a one stop shop for all of your wordlists needs. 
When you think of SecLists I want you to think "rockyou.txt" but for everything. 

---

### 5. **How to use SecLists?**

Getting access to SecLists is super easy. 

If you want to download individual lists then browse through the GitHub repository and find one that fits your needs and then grab it with wget, like this:

`wget raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/file -o filename.txt`

You can view the raw URL of a file by clicking the "Raw" button and copying the URL into your wget command.

Also, remember wget can be used on windows in powershell.
