### 3. **What is URLcrazy?**

Have you ever mistyped a URL and ended up at a totally different address? or perhaps, the mistype redirected you to the correct URL? Mistyped URLs are a common vector of attack that malicious actors use to target innocent users. 

URLcrazy is a tool that allows generation of typos on a set deomain to test for typo squatting (what I described above), URL hijacking, phishing and espionage.

### 4. **Why use URLcrazy?**

A penetration tester may use URLcrazy to create a domain that closely resembles the correct URL to attempt phishing attacks against the target. 

An organization may purchase mistyped domains to ensure hijackers and malicious actors do not buy that URL for future attacks.
