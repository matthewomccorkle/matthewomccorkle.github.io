### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **fifty-fourth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **BloodHound** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).

BloodHound was created by [Andy Robbins](https://twitter.com/_wald0), [Rohan Vazarkar](https://twitter.com/CptJesus), and [Will Schroeder](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the BloodHound tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my victim network I am using the TryhackMe room ["Post-Exploitation Basics"](https://tryhackme.com/room/postexploit).

### 3. **What is BloodHound?**

Bloodhound is a tool used by security researchers to determine attack paths to domain compromise within an Active Directory environment. 

---

### 4. **Why use BloodHound?**

Security administrators would use BloodHound to map out potential attack paths within their environment and then harden or remove those attack paths so that they cannot be compromised.

Penetration testers would use BloodHound to find potential attack paths and then exploit those paths to gain privilege escalation and pivot within a network.
