### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-third** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **Gobuster** [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Gobuster tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is Gobuster?**

Gobuster is another enumeration and web scanning tool for finding DNS names, IP addresses, directories, S3 buckets and more for a given domain, IP address, etc. 

I am going to use Gobuster today to find directories on the DVWA of Metasploitable 2 instance.

### 4. **Why use Gobuster?**

I like to use GoBuster as a fast alternative to tools like Dirbuster or Dirb. 

Gobuster scans take seconds to minutes while Dirbuster often fails or takes so long that I cancel the scan. 

Dirb is a great directory enumeration tool that does thorough scans, I talked about Dirb [here](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/day_006_dirb/) on day 6!

### 5. **How to use Gobuster?**

    Step 1:
    Gobuster is fairly simple to use. 
    To see the help options just type gobuster in your terminal:

    gobuster
