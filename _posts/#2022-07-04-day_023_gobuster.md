## This post is designed to introduce you to the tool Gobuster.

### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-third** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **Gobuster** [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Gobuster tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is Gobuster?**

Gobuster is another enumeration and web scanning tool for finding DNS names, IP addresses, directories, S3 buckets and more for a given domain, IP address, etc. 

I am going to use Gobuster today to find directories on the DVWA of Metasploitable 2 instance.

---

### 4. **Why use Gobuster?**

I like to use GoBuster as a fast alternative to tools like Dirbuster or Dirb. 

Gobuster scans take seconds to minutes while Dirbuster often fails or takes so long that I cancel the scan. 

Dirb is a great directory enumeration tool that does thorough scans, I talked about Dirb [here](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/day_006_dirb/) on day 6!

### 5. **How to use Gobuster?**

    Step 1:
    Gobuster is fairly simple to use. 
    To see the help options just type gobuster in your terminal:

    gobuster

    To see help on a specific mode type:

    gobuster help <mode>
    gobuster help dir

    Step 2:
    I am going to scan web server on Metasploitable 2.
    The command for Gobuster is fairly simple despite its length. 
    Use the following command:

<br>

`gobuster dir -u http://192.168.175.128 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster/initial -e`

<br>

    dir = directory mode
    -u = specifying the URL to scan
    -w = wordlist to use for scanning
    -o = I output the file to a directory named gobuster and named the file initial
    -e = show the full URL path of found directories

Anyone familiar with DVWA and Metasploitable 2 knows that there is a page named < IP Address >/DVWA and from our results we see that Gobuster did not find it, this is because DVWA is not in my wordlist file.

### 6. **Summary**

Gobuster is a fast and easy to use tool for scanning websites for directories, DNS, S3 buckets, and other options. 

I like to use Gobuster side by side with some of the other directory discovery tools like Dirb or even Dirbuster.

I hope you enjoyed this post and can use Gobuster in your future!
