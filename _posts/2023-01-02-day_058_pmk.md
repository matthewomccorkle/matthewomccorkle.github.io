### 5. **How to use Pimp My Kali?**

Navigate to Dewalt-Arch's GitHub and clone their repository on your fresh Kali Linux install. Open a terminal window to begin.

    Step 1:
    In your terminal enter the following command to clone Pimp My Kali

    git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali.git

<br>

Next, navigate to the directory where you cloned the Pimp My Kali repository and ensure that `pimpmykali.sh` has executable permissions.
    
    Step 2 (Optional):
    cd pimpmykali && chmod +x pimpmykali.sh

<br> 

Now you are ready to run the `pimpmykali.sh` script. Ensure you run the script as root or using sudo.

    Step 3:
    
    sudo ./pimpmykali.sh

You should see the following option menu display within your terminal window.

At this point you have many options to modify your Kali Linux installation. For this demonstration I am only performing the `N` option which is a kitchen sink type selection that fixes nearly all of the options `0-9`.

During this process you should be asked if you want to merge all of your home/kali/ files to root/ directory, this is your option, I choose no. 

Additionally, if you answer yes to setting up a root login, you will need to provide a new root password. 

Once complete, you should see the following output in your terminal window:
