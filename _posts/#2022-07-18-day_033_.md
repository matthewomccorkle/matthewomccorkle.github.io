### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirty-third** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **asciinema** [here](https://asciinema.org/).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the asciinema tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is asciinema?**

asciinema is a terminal recording tool. 

asiinema records your commands and typing and saves it as a file. 

What is really great about this tool is that when you play the recording back, it plays it in your terminal where you can copy and past commands and words as recorded.

### 4. **Why use asciinema?**

Education! You can record your command line work and then send it to other for educational purposes.

Record Keeping! You can use this to create a record of work completed for your own records or submission to employer, etc. 

Documenting penetration test attacks! You can use this tool to document your commands used during penetration testing. This can then be used in a digital report format for your client. Additionally, you can use this recording for junior testers on your team to reference and learn from during their testing. 

Evidence! You can use this tool to create evidence recordings ( of course see if your jurisdiction allows this as evidence).

### 5. **How to use asciinema?**

First you need to install asciinema onto your device. There are many ways to do that listed [here](https://asciinema.org/docs/installation).
Because I am using Debian Linux (Kali runs on Debian) I am going to use the apt command.

    Step 0 (optional):
    If you want to upload your asciinema recordings register for an account at:

    https://asciinema.org/login/new

<br>    
    
    Step 1:
    Run the following command to download and install the package:

    sudo apt-get install asciinema

<br>

    Step 2 (optional):
    If you want to authorize your recordings to upload to asciinema.org type:

    asciinema auth

    Follow the terminal prompt and copy & paste the website 
    into a browser where you are logged in to asciinema.org

<br>

<br>

    Step 2:
    To being recording your terminal type:

    asciinema rec

<br>

![]()

<br>

    Step 3:
    Stop recording by typing:
    
    exit
    
    This will prompt whether you want to save the recording locally 
    or to your online asciinema.org account.
