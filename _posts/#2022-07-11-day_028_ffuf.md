### 4. **Why use ffuf?**

Matthew we have GoBuster, Dirb, Dirbuster, why use Ffuf? 

Ffuf is fast, really fast. But Ffuf offers so many more options than just directory searching (though today I will show it's recursive directory search capabilities). Ffuf can find file extensions, offers filtering and matching options, integrates with Burpsuite and a local proxy. I know that this does not cover every aspect of Ffuf. 

If you want to see more details on how to use Ffuf as an advanced user check out Michael Skelton's video at his website Codingo here: <br>
