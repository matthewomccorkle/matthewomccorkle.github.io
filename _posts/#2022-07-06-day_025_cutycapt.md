### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-fifth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **Cutycapt** here: [http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/](http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Cutycapt tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is Cutycapt?**

If you read my post from day 16 on the tool Httrack [here](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/day_016_httrack/), then you are familiar with copying an entire website to your device for offline use. 

Cutycapt takes a picture of an entire website and saves it in various formats (to include PDF). 

---

### 4. **Why use Cutycapt?**

Cutycapt works in the terminal as command line only, if you did not have a browser to take screenshots you could use Cutycapt to still capture a website screenshot and save it as your desired filetype.

If you have access to Google Chrome or Firefox you can ofcourse take a better screenshot using developer tools which I will show as a bonus step in section 5 of this blog post.

### 5. **How to use Cutycapt?**

    Step 1:
    To use Cutycapt open your terminal window and type:

    cutycapt -h

    This will open the help menu for Cutycapt.
