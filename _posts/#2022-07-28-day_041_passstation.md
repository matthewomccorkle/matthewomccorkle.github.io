 Pass Station is a command line tool which searches and displays default credentials for thousands of products and vendors.

### 4. **Why use Pass Station?**

During penetration testing a tester may find multiple services and hardware on the attack surface of the environment they are testing. 

Many organizations and administrators often glance over default credentials set for accessing those services and hardware, thus leaving the defaults as is. 

Pass Station offers a quick and searchable databse of thousands of these credential combinations known for many services and pieces of equipment that exist. 

Using a command line tool allows the tester to quickly discover and test for the found default credentials from the database that Pass Station provides.
