### 3. **What is theHarvester?**

First we need to describe open-source intelligence to understand theHarvester.<br>
You may recall from the last post #12 that used a tool named Instaloader to grab content from Instagram.<br>
Technically, the content that is easily available to the public is considered open-source intelligence. Anyone could access  the information.<br>
theHarvester takes advantage of the massive amount of open-source intelligence that exists on the internet and finds specific information that a user is searching for. <br>
**Imagine** a google for the results of google. 

As of writing this post theHarvester has 40 passive search data sources which it can use to find open-source intelligence. 

Some of the sources do require API keys to function appropriately, so check out the GitHub for information on which sources contain additional requirements.

### 4. **Why use theHarvester?**

For personal research you could use theHarvester to find all LinkedIn users who have affiliated themselves with an organization. With this information you could then reach out to apprpriate connections that may work in the same field as yourself. 

For penetration testing you could use theHarvester to build the open-source data points while conducting your passive reconnaisance on a taret.

theHarvester can also be used for finding DNS, IP addresses, subdomains,
