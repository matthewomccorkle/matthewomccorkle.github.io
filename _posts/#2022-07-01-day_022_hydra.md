### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-second** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **hydra** [here](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the hydra tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment. 

For my username list I am using [this](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt) file from Daniel Miessler which has common usernames.

### 3. **What is hydra?**

Hydra is an online password cracking tool.

Penetration testers and developers use Hydra to perform dictionary attacks against login forms on websites and online services.

### 4. **Why use hydra?**

As a penetration tester you may have to crack the username and password for a login form on a website. Note, using Hydra will definitely send a lot of requests to the server which will likely trigger password lockout, IDS or IPS rules. Also, using Hydra on any site you are not authorized to is considered illegal.

### 5. **How to use hydra?**

I am going to use Hydra to perform a dictionary password attack against the Metasploitable 2 DVWA login page.

You can see some of the simple methods of using hydra by typing `hydra` into your terminal.

For a more detailed help page type `hydra -h` in your terminal.

In order to properly perform this dicitionary attack I am going to use Burpsuite to capture the information that is sent during the HTTP request of a failed login. 

I know we have not covered burpsuite yet (Burpsuite could be a week long blog on it's own), so I have a quick GIF below which shows how I captured the data I need. Additionally, I have a graphic below the GIF which shows the data I need from Burpsuite to make teh Hydra command.

    Step 1:
    Capture the HTTP request during a failed login using Burpsuite.
