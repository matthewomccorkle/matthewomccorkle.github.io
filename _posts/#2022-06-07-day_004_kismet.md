## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Lynis* accomplishes and how to use it.

---

### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the third blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Lynis tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment. 

---

### 3. **What is Lynis?**

Lynis is a security and auditing tool. 

The creators have made a free and open-source solution as well as a paid enterprise solution.

Lynis allows for a user or administrator to perform a local in-depth scan of a system to find vulnerabilities, perform a health check and find weaknesses in configuration.

Lynis only works on Linux systems, so if you have other systems to scan you may want to consider other solutions. 

Find Lynis at the creator's GitHub [here](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis) or their website [here](https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/get-started/).

---

### 4. **Why use Lynis?**

For personal use:

- Determine weaknesses in your home setup.

- Conduct a regularly scheduled system health checkup. 

For enterprise solutions:

- Perform audits based on specific compliance requirements. 

- Apply suggested system hardening from the tool post-audit.

### 5. **How to use Lynis?**

**On any Linux system**
    
    Step 1: 
    Clone Lynis from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git
<br>

<br>

    Step 2:
    Change directory into the lynis folder that was cloned.

    cd lynis

<br>

    Step 3:
    Run Lynis in system audit mode:
    ./lynis audit system
<br>

<br>

    Step 3b:
    Want to run Lynis in privileged scan mode? Try:

    sudo ./lynis audit system

    Type Y and hit enter when prompted.

**Results:**<br>
The results of the Lynis audit are displayed in your terminal window. 

At the bottom of the results, we have warnings and suggestions.

These are actions you can take to harden your system.<br>

Additionally, Lynis gives you a hardening index which is a gauge of how hardened your system is.<br>**Note**: This is just a gauge for system hardening and not a gauge for actual system security. 

As you can see my hardening index is not as great as it could be, but that is okay as this is a virtual machine I throw away at the end of writing each blog.

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Lynis is, and some of its capabilities.

We briefly discussed how to install and use Lynis and how to read the audit report for implementing system hardening. 

Play around with Lynis and see if you can implement some of the suggestions Lynis has for your system's security. 

More resources can be found on the Lynis GitHub [here](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis).<br>
