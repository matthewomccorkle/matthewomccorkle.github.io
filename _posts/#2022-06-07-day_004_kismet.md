### 1. **Introduction**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/kismet/kismet1.png)

Welcome to the fourth blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it.

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Kismet tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment. 

For my network card I used an Alfa Network AWUS036NHA USB card in monitor mode.<br> 
You can find that exact card [here](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NHA-Wireless-USB-Adaptor/dp/B004Y6MIXS) on Amazon.

***Note***: In order for you to use Kismet you will need a wireless card that has monitor mode. <br>
The majority of wireless cards do not have monitor mode. 
<br>Please see an article [here](https://deviwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Wireless_Adapters_That_Support_Monitor_Mode_and_Packet_Injection) on monitor capable wireless cards.

### 3. **What is Kismet?**

"Kismet is a wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework." - Kismet [website](https://www.kismetwireless.net/).

Basically Kismet allows you to see and analyze wireless networks around you.<br>
Also, Kismet can act as a intrusion detection device to protect your own network. See more on that [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/wireless-security-using-raspberry-pi-4-kismet-and-python/).

Find Kismet at the creator's GitHub [here](https://github.com/kismetwireless/kismet) or their website [here](https://www.kismetwireless.net/).

### 4. **Why use Kismet?**

For personal use:

- Determine what networks are around you to determine best channel to set your WiFi accesss point.

- Determine if rogue or malicious devices are around you.

For professional use:

- Penetration testing on approved infrastructure.

- Determine if hidden devices have been setup in your area of operation.

- Wireless intrusion detection service.

There are many uses for Kismet, more uses than I can go over in this concise and simple blog post.

If you are interested in WiFi management and information I suggest you look more into the uses Kismet offers. 

## <span style="color:red">***Disclaimer***</span>:<br>
**Please only use Kismet for testing and understanding wireless networks you have explicit legal access to.**

### 5. **How to use Kismet?**

**Kali or ParrotOS**
    
    Step 1: 
    You need to ensure your wireless card is in monitor mode.
    Run the following command:

    ifconfig

    Below you will see that my card is not in monitor mode.

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Kismet is, and some of its capabilities.

We briefly discussed how to install and use Kismet and how to read the audit report for implementing system hardening. 

Play around with Kismet and see if you can implement some of the suggestions Kismet has for your system's security.
