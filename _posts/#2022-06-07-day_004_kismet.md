## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Kismet* accomplishes and how to use it.

### 1. **Introduction**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/kismet/kismet1.png)

Welcome to the fourth blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Kismet tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment. 

For my network card I used an Alfa Network AWUS036NHA USB card in monitor mode.<br> 
You can find that exact card [here](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NHA-Wireless-USB-Adaptor/dp/B004Y6MIXS) on Amazon.

***Note***: In order for you to use Kismet you will need a wireless card that has monitor mode. <br>
The majority of wireless cards do not have monitor mode. 
<br>Please see an article [here](https://deviwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Wireless_Adapters_That_Support_Monitor_Mode_and_Packet_Injection) on monitor capable wireless cards.

### 3. **What is Kismet?**

Kismet is a security and auditing tool. 

The creators have made a free and open-source solution as well as a paid enterprise solution.

Kismet allows for a user or administrator to perform a local in-depth scan of a system to find vulnerabilities, perform a health check and find weaknesses in configuration.

Kismet only works on Linux systems, so if you have other systems to scan you may want to consider other solutions. 

Find Kismet at the creator's GitHub [here](https://github.com/CISOfy/Kismet) or their website [here](https://cisofy.com/documentation/Kismet/get-started/).

### 4. **Why use Kismet?**

For personal use:

- Determine weaknesses in your home setup.

- Conduct a regularly scheduled system health checkup. 

For enterprise solutions:

- Perform audits based on specific compliance requirements. 

- Apply suggested system hardening from the tool post-audit.

### 5. **How to use Kismet?**

**On any Linux system**
    
    Step 1: 
    Clone Kismet from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/Kismet.git
<br>

<br>

    Step 2:
    Change directory into the Kismet folder that was cloned.

    cd Kismet

<br>

    Step 3:
    Run Kismet in system audit mode:
    ./Kismet audit system
<br>

<br>

    Step 3b:
    Want to run Kismet in privileged scan mode? Try:

    sudo ./Kismet audit system

    Type Y and hit enter when prompted.

**Results:**<br>
The results of the Kismet audit are displayed in your terminal window. 

At the bottom of the results, we have warnings and suggestions.

These are actions you can take to harden your system.<br>

Additionally, Kismet gives you a hardening index which is a gauge of how hardened your system is.<br>**Note**: This is just a gauge for system hardening and not a gauge for actual system security. 

As you can see my hardening index is not as great as it could be, but that is okay as this is a virtual machine I throw away at the end of writing each blog.

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Kismet is, and some of its capabilities.

We briefly discussed how to install and use Kismet and how to read the audit report for implementing system hardening. 

Play around with Kismet and see if you can implement some of the suggestions Kismet has for your system's security. 

More resources can be found on the Kismet GitHub [here](https://github.com/CISOfy/Kismet).<br>
