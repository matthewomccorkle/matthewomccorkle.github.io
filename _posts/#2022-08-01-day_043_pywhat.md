### 2. **My Setup**

For running the pyWhat tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

I used the following PCAP files from Marcelle Lee for analysis:

### 3. **What is pyWhat?**

pyWhat is a discovery tool which analyzes input such as strings, files, GitHub repositories, and web pages and identifies information found as standard out. 

---

### 4. **Why use pyWhat?**

pyWhat can help a security researcher perform a quick analysis on a PCAP file from a network scanner. 

Penetration testers may use pyWhat to find leaked data in GitHub repositories or websites of organizations they perform testing on. This is a tool that could be used in the OSINT phase of passive reconnaissance and in the active reconnaissance portion of testing.

### 5. **How to use pyWhat?**

Installing pyWhat is easy and requires pip3 from python, if you have been following my posts we installed pip3 previously, but here is the command to install if you need it still:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

    Step 1:
    Install pyWhat by entering the following command into your terminal:

    sudo pip3 install pywhat[optimize]
