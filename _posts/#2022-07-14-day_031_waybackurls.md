### 4. **Why use waybackurls?**

Finding old domains is usually a form of reconnaissance for any penetration tester. Using waybackurls a tester could grab all of the urls from waybackmachine with a simple command. 

The tester could output the urls into a file where further sorting and analysis could be performed to find information from old sections of the website.
