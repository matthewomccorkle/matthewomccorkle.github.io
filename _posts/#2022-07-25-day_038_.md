### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirty-eighth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **BruteShark** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/odedshimon/BruteShark).

**BruteShark** was created by Oded Shimon find him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oded-shimon-6ba6721a8/)!

Find Oded Shimon's blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@contact.oded.shimon).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the BruteShark tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For the sample PCAP files I used the ones provided by Oded on the BruteShark GitHub [here](https://github.com/odedshimon/BruteShark/tree/master/Pcap_Examples).

You can download them using the command:

    svn checkout https://github.com/odedshimon/BruteShark/trunk/Pcap_Examples

### 3. **What is BruteShark?**

Directly from Oded Shimon's description:

"BruteShark is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) that performs deep processing and inspection of network traffic (mainly PCAP files, but it also capable of directly live capturing from a network interface). It includes: password extracting, building a network map, reconstruct TCP sessions, extract hashes of encrypted passwords and even convert them to a Hashcat format in order to perform an offline Brute Force attack." -[Oded Shimon](https://github.com/odedshimon/BruteShark#:~:text=BruteShark%20is%20a,Brute%20Force%20attack).

So in other words we can extract files, credentials, build network diagrams, and reconstruct sessions from PCAP files and live capture of network traffic. 

Today I will use only the example PCAP files to perform a file extraction, credential extraction, and network diagram creation.

### 4. **Why use BruteShark?**

BruteShark allows a network administrator to analyze traffic for malicious activity, insecure communication methods, weak passwords, and find vulnerabilities in the networking configuration.

A penetration tester may use BruteShark to capture network traffic for offline extraction of credentials, build a network diagram, and extracting files that may leak information.
