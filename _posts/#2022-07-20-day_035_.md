### 2. **My Setup**

I used the web version of the XSS Hunter tool located at [xsshunter.com](https://xsshunter.com/).

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is XSS Hunter?**

XSS Hunter is a web based automatic XSS payload generator and tester.

### 4. **Why use XSS Hunter?**

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) lists cross-site scripting in the top ten security issues on the web as #3 [source](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

Security researchers, penetration testers, developers, bug bounty hunters, etc. often look for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities on web apps. 

XSS Hunter allows for quick and easy payload generation using a custom domain aligned with your XSS Hunter account. Everytime you use a XSS Hunter payload the web application captures a screenshot of the vulnerable site and other information to document the vulnerability.

Additionally, a user can setup XSS Hunter Express on their own device and host their own site with payloads for use with XSS Hunter.

### 5. **How to use XSS Hunter?**

For my example I am using XSS Hunter web version to submit a XSS payload to my Metasploitable 2 Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), I have turned security down to low on DVWA to ensure the XSS attempt works for this example. 

Sign up for your XSS Hunter account here: [https://xsshunter.com/signup](https://xsshunter.com/signup)


    Step 1:

    Navigate to the Payloads section of the website and choose a payload to test.

    I chose the basic XSS payload as I know that it will work on the DVWA.
