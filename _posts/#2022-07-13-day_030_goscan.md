### 2. **My Setup**

For running the GoScan tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I used the room SimpleCTF on TryHackMe [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf).

### 3. **What is GoScan?**

GoScan is a network scanner that is written in the Go language. It is fast, reliable and performs its tasks in its own shell. 

---

### 4. **Why use GoScan?**

If you need a network scanner that uses Nmap functionality, but also stores findings in an SQL database for future reference this is the tool for you. 

If you are a CTF player or allowed noisy access as a penetration tester this may be the tool for you!

Most importantly, GoScan offers a lot of auto complete options to speed up your scanning process.

### 5. **How to use GoScan?**

GoScan is not native to Kali Linux so I will first show you how to install it.

I am going to follow the binary installation instructions provided on the GitHub page for GoScan [here](https://github.com/marco-lancini/goscan#binary-installation-recommended).

    Step 1:
    Ensure you have root permissions either as root (bad) or as a sudo user (good).

    Use the following commands to get, and setup GoScan:

`wget https://github.com/marco-lancini/goscan/releases/download/v2.4/goscan_2.4_linux_amd64.zip`
<br>

`unzip goscan_2.4_linux_amd64.zip`
<br>

`chmod +x goscan`
<br>

`sudo mv ./goscan /usr/local/bin/goscan`
<br>

    Step 2:
    Lets run GoScan. To do so ensure you use sudo when starting GoScan.

    sudo goscan

<br>

    Step 3:
