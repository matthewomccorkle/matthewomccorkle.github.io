### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirtieth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **GoScan** [here](https://github.com/marco-lancini/goscan).

Marco Lancini developed GoScan and you can find his social profiles here:

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the GoScan tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I used the room SimpleCTF on TryHackMe [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf).

---

### 3. **What is GoScan?**

GoScan is a network scanner that is written in the Go language. It is fast, reliable and performs its tasks in its own shell. 

---

### 4. **Why use GoScan?**

If you need a network scanner that uses Nmap functionality, but also stores findings in an SQL database for future reference this is the tool for you. 

If you are a CTF player or allowed noisy access as a penetration tester this may be the tool for you!

Most importantly, GoScan offers a lot of auto complete options to speed up your scanning process.

### 5. **How to use GoScan?**

GoScan is not native to Kali Linux so I will first show you how to install it.

I am going to follow the binary installation instructions provided on the GitHub page for GoScan [here](https://github.com/marco-lancini/goscan#binary-installation-recommended).

    Step 1:
    Ensure you have root permissions either as root (bad) or as a sudo user (good).

    Use the following commands to get, and setup GoScan:

`wget https://github.com/marco-lancini/goscan/releases/download/v2.4/goscan_2.4_linux_amd64.zip`
<br>

`unzip goscan_2.4_linux_amd64.zip`
<br>

`chmod +x goscan`
<br>

`sudo mv ./goscan /usr/local/bin/goscan`
<br>

    Step 2:
    Lets run GoScan. To do so ensure you use sudo when starting GoScan.
    If you are not root then you will see the below error.

    sudo goscan

<br>

<br>

GoScan started in it's own shell:

<br>


    Step 3:
    Once in the GoScan shell you can type help to see the options.

    Step 4:
    To begin my scan I set my Load target variable to the single 
    TryHackMe IP discussed earlier. 

    load target SINGLE 10.10.230.16/32

<br>

One of the great aspects of GoScan is the auto-suggest function. See it live below:

![](https://github.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/blob/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/goscan/goscan.gif)

    Step 5:
    I need to verify the host is alive by running a PING test:

    sweep PING ALL

    Note: some hosts will not respond to PING tests.

    Step 6:
    Next I want to verify the host is up and ALIVE.

    show hosts

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/goscan/goscan6.PNG)

    Step 7:
    Next I need to load the alive host before performing the TCP scan.

    load alive SINGLE 10.10.230.16/32

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/goscan/goscan7a.PNG)

    Step 8:
    With the alive host set I can now perform a standard TCP scan:

    portscan TCP-STANDARD 10.10.230.16

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/goscan/goscan7.PNG)

    Step 9:
    Once the standard TCP scan is complete I can view the hosts/ports again and see what was found.

    show hosts

    show ports

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/goscan/goscan8.PNG)

    Step 10:
    From the returned hosts results we can see that nmap found port 21 and 80 open.

    From here we can use the enumerate option to perform further analysis.
    Additionally, you can use the dry option to show you the command GoScan would run before choosing that option.

    enumerate FTP DRY 10.10.230.16

    enumerate HTTP DRY 10.10.230.16
