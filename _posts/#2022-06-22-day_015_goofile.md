### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **fifteenth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **goofile** [here](https://github.com/sosukeinu/goofile).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the goofile tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is goofile?**

If you have been following my last few posts you will see that I am on an open-source pattern.

Goofile is an opensource tool which scans a domain for a file type and returns the path to the files.

### 4. **Why use goofile?**

Imagine you are a penetration tester and the organization you are performing legal and ethical penetration testing on has important documents or file types available on their website. 

Instead of searching every possible link and enumerating all possible paths of a domain, you can perform and quick search for specific file types using goofile. 

Goofile can give a penetration tester an early edge during enumeration if they find files that contain information that allows entry into the system.

### <span style="color:red">***Warning***</span>: 
**goofile** may cause an overload of requests to Google, if this happens you may need to setup a Custom Site Search Engine, please follow the developers instructions [here](https://github.com/sosukeinu/goofile#enhancements) if this happens to you.

### 5. **How to use goofile?**

    Step 1:
    In your terminal in Kali Linux type the following command:

    goofile

    if it is not installed type y and hit enter.
