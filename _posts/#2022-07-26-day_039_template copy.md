### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirty-ninth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **WifiInfo** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/codingo/Retrieve-Windows-Wifi-Passwords).

Michael Skelton wrote WifiInfo and you can find him on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skeltonm/).

### 2. **My Setup**

This is a PowerShell script, so today I shifted my focus to a Windows 10 device and connected to some networks so you could see the script in use. 

You could run this script through SSH or other reverse shell methodologies from a Linux computer to a victim Windows device.
