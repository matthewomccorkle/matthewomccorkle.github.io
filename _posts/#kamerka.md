### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Kamerka tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

**NOTE :** in order for Kamerka to work properly you will need to sign up for API keys from:

Shodan (PAID Version)
BinaryEdge
Google Maps
WhoisXML
Flickr
Twitter
PasteBin

If you are unsure of how to get access to API keys try typing this into Google:

`shodan api key`

or

`binary edge api key`

### 3. **What is Kamerka?**

Kamerka is a tool that uses public facing websites like Shodan to search for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Control System (ICS) devices. 

---

### 4. **Why use Kamerka?**

Often a penetration tester is given a "black box" scenario where they will not have any information or access to an organizations network. In order to find a vulnerable entry point some times they must look for IoT or ICS devices that are publicly connected to the internet and vulnerable. 

As a security researcher or developer you may want to analyze your network or organizations environment to ensure IoT and ICS devices are not publicly accessible. 

Kamerka offers a browser based search engine using API connections to Shodan, BinaryEdge, Google Maps, WhoisXML, Flickr, Twitter and PaseBin to find vulnerable devices online. 

You will need API keys for each of the mentioned services.

### 5. **How to use Kamerka?**
