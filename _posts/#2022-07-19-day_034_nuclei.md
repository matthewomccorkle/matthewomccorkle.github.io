### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirty-fourth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **nuclei** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei).

Find **nuclei** @ Project Discovery [here](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/).

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the nuclei tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is nuclei?**

An extremely powerful command line based vulnerability scanner engine which uses templates for finding vulnerabilities.

---

### 4. **Why use nuclei?**

nuclei is an engine that performs vulnerability scans based on templates. templates dictate what vulnerabilities nuclei scans for. 

Therefore, having strong templates are critical for nuclei working efficiently and accurately.

Project Discovery offers default community built templates which are validated by the community and Project Discovery before being added to the default template lists. Currently there are over 3,000 default templates that nuclei can use. 

A security researcher, pentester or bug bounty hunter can truly harness the full power of nuclei by making their own custom templates that are customized for the systems they are testing. 

A developer or defensive security employee may use nuclei to test code and projects throughout the development process.

### 5. **How to use nuclei?**

Downloading nuclei onto your Linux device is easy. You will need Go installed, therefore if you do not have Go, check out my instructions on installing Go [here](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/day_031_waybackurls/#:~:text=If%20you%20do%20not%20have%20Go%20installed%20or%20do%20not%20have%20your%20variables%20set%20up%20for%20running%20go%20binaries%20perform%20Step%200%20first.) from day 31.

    Step 1:
    In your terminal enter the following command:

    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v2/cmd/nuclei@latest

<br>

    Step 2:
    Verify nuclei installed by entering the following command:

    nuclei -h

    This should bring up the help page for nuclei.

Running nuclei is easy and fast if you are relying on the default templates. 
Below is a default template scan on the Metasploitable2 machine.

    Step 3:
    Run the following command to perform a default scan:

    nuclei -u URL.OR.IP.ADDRESS
