#### This blog is designed to give some background information on honeypots, and the results of running T-Pot for 48 hours.

#### This series is broken into 3 parts.

# 9. What would I do differently next time?
Next time I run a honeypot I will implement a intrusion detection system to create alerts of specific event types.<br>
I would use SNORT likely as it is free, open source, and versatile.<br>
I would also implement a secondary server to run a Splunk instance and capture the SNORT alerts as well as the honeypot logs.<br>

# 10. Summary

# 11. What did I learn?

1. I learned how to setup a blog site using Github. 
   
   a. This led to learning some Jekyll language.

   b. This taught me how commits and pulls work on Github.

   c. I learned markdown just so I could make a blog that is free, open source, without paywalls and do not require you to login to read. 

2. I learned how the Elastic and Kibana system work. 
   
   a. This led to learning a different search and analysis method that was outside of my Splunk knowledge.

3. There are *so many* bots on the internet. Do they struggle with captcha's like I do?
