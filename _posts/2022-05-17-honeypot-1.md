# Part 1 - What is a Honeypot

#### This blog is designed to give some background information on honeypots, how to setup the T-Pot, and the results of running T-Pot for 48 hours.

#### This series is broken into 4 parts.

### [Part 1:](https://matthewomccorkle.github.io/honeypot-1/) <*You are here!*

1. What is a honeypot?

2. What did I use my honeypot for?

10. What would I do differently next time?

11. Summary

12. What did I learn?

# 1. What is a honeypot?

According to Merriam-Webster a honeypot is *"one that is attractive or desirable"*<sub>[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honeypot)</sub>

Wikipedia describes a Honeypot as *"a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems."*<sub>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)#:~:text=a%20computer%20security%20mechanism%20set%20to%20detect%2C%20deflect%2C%20or%2C%20in%20some%20manner%2C%20counteract%20attempts%20at%20unauthorized%20use%20of%20information%20systems.)</sub>

In the information security realm, a honeypot is defined by the function it is used for and the purpose of one honeypot may not share the purpose of another honeypot.  

**tldr:** Generally a honeypot is a vulnerable system with a wide attack surface that attracts attackers, logs their activities and displays the information in a log format. 

# 2. What did I use my honeypot for?

My honeypot ran for 48 hours with a public facing IP address and ports 1-64000 open. 
**Note**: Not all ports had services running. 

My intent was to gather as much intel as possible on attackers techniques and then analyze that data to determine the following:

- Common ports tested for vulnerabilities.

- Commands used by attackers.

- Passwords used by attackers.

- Countries of origin.

- Detect CVE's in a real environment.

# 3. What honeypot setup did I use?

#### [T-Pot!](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce)

I built my honeypot on an Amazon Web Services EC2 Debian 11 server using a t3.xlarge instance. I used the **Bahrain** `me-south-1` region for my instance.

Using AWS was the quick and convenient method for running the honeypot because of:

- Ease spinning up services in AWS.

- Ease of networking in AWS.
  
  - Obtaining an elastic IP address and having it connected to your instance is quick and effortless.

- Ease of security groups in AWS.

- No hardware requirements.

Reasons AWS might not be right for you:

1. ~$10/day this can get costly.

2. Provisioning of resources manually.

#### Minimum Requirements for T-Pot

Minimum suggested requirements for running T-Pot can be found here: 
[🍯 T-Pot - The All In One Honeypot Platform 🐝](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce#system-requirements).

#### Honeypots included in T-Pot:

All information for ports and honeypots can be found [here](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce#technical-concept).

#### Services & Technologies used

- Amazon Web Services (EC2) -  for hosting your Honeypot.

- SSH terminal of choice - for initial setup.

- Kabana / Elastic Stack - For searching through logs of attacks and displaying the data nicely.

- Honeypots - 22 various Honeypots.

- Linode Instances - For downloading and interacting with payloads.

# 4. Expected outcomes

I expected many of the attacks and probes of ports will be automated from bots. 

I expected to see CVE's of all types. 

I expected to see attacks from a diverse global footprint.
