[Summary]

# What is a honeypot?

According to Merriam-Webster a honeypot is *"one that is attractive or desirable"*<sub>[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honeypot)</sub>

In the information security realm, a honeypot is defined by the function it is used for. 

Wikipedia describes a Honeypot as *"a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems."*<sub>[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)#:~:text=a%20computer%20security%20mechanism%20set%20to%20detect%2C%20deflect%2C%20or%2C%20in%20some%20manner%2C%20counteract%20attempts%20at%20unauthorized%20use%20of%20information%20systems.)</sub>

**tldr:** Generally a honeypot is a vulnerable system with a wide attack surface that attracts attackers, logs their activities and displays the informaation in a log format. 



# What did I use my honeypot for?

My honeypot ran for **XX** days with a public facing IP address, with ports 1-64000 open. **Note**: Not all ports had services running. 

My intention was to gather as much intel as possible on attackers techniques and then analyze that data to determine the following:

- Top 10 ports tested for vulnerabilities.

- Top 10 commands used by attackers.

- Top 10 passwords used by attackers.

- Top 10 countries of origin.

# What honeypot setup did I use?

###### Minimum Requirements for T-Pot

# Services & Technologies used

# How to setup T-Pot

# Expected outcomes before running honeypot

# Analysis of logs

- Top 10 ports tested for vulnerabilities.

- Top 10 commands used by attackers.

- Top 10 passwords used by attackers.

- Top 10 countries of origin.
