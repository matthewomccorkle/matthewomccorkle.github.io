# What is a Honeypot?

According to Merriam-Webster a honeypot is "one that is attractive or desirable"<sub>[1](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honeypot)</sub>

In the information security realm, a Honeypot is defined by the function it is used for. WikiPedia describes a Honeypot as "a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems."<sub>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)#:~:text=a%20computer%20security%20mechanism%20set%20to%20detect%2C%20deflect%2C%20or%2C%20in%20some%20manner%2C%20counteract%20attempts%20at%20unauthorized%20use%20of%20information%20systems.)</sub>
