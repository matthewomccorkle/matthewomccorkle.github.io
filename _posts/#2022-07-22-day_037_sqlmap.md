### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirty-seventh** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Find **sqlmap** @ GitHub [here](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap).

Find **sqlmap** @ sqlmap.org [here](https://sqlmap.org/).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the sqlmap tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For my vulnerable host, I am using the Metasploitable 2 instance running in a VMWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is sqlmap?**

sqlmap is a penetration testing tool that automates the detection and exploitation process of sql vulnerabilities.  

---

### 4. **Why use sqlmap?**

sqlmap makes SQL enumeration, and exploitation simple and quick for a penetration tester. 

Security researchers could use sqlmap to test their SQL databases for vulnerabilities and harden those systems.

### 5. **How to use sqlmap?**

The following steps will show basic usage of sqlmap to retrieve usernames and passwords from the DVWA SQL database using low security settings.

I know we have not covered BurpSuite or OWASP ZAP, or other web traffic intercept methods, but I will give a brief overview of how I captured cookie data from BurpSuite.

I won't show how to install, configure or use BurpSuite today, as that is a series of blog posts for a future time. 

    Step 1:
    Open Burpsuite, navigate to Proxy -> Intercept

    - Ensure "Intercept is off" reads "Intercept is on"

    Click "Open Browser"

<br>

![]()

    Step 2:
    Navigate to the page you want to test for SQL injection.

    This will activate the intercept mode in Burpsuite where you will need to click "Forward" until the page is loaded.

<br>

![]()



    Active the SQL injection form by clicking login, submit, enter, etc. 

    For DVWA, the button is labeled "Submit"

    This will activate Burpsuite
