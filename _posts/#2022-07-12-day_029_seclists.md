### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **twenty-ninth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 

Today will be a lighter post and involve a resource that can supplement many of the tools we have covered as well as many tools you may use. 

Find **SecLists** [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/).

SecLists is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddiz, and g0tmi1k on GitHub.

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the SecLists tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is SecLists?**

SecLists is a repository of lists used during directory discovery, web fuzzing, password spraying, web testing, URL discovery, username discovery, password discovery, and many other uses. 

---

### 4. **Why use SecLists?**

SecLists is a one-stop-shop for all of your wordlist needs. 
When you think of SecLists I want you to think "rockyou.txt" but for everything. 

SecLists wordlists are divided into directory categories for ease of use.

### 5. **How to use SecLists?**

Getting access to SecLists is super easy. 

### **Option 1 (Individual Lists):**
If you want to download individual lists then browse through the GitHub repository and find one that fits your needs and then grab it with wget, like this:

`wget raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/file -o filename.txt`

You can view the raw URL of a file by clicking the "Raw" button and copying the URL into your wget command.

Also, remember wget can be used on Windows in PowerShell.

### **Option 2 (Entire Repository):**

You can use the git clone command to clone the entire repository into your directory.

`git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git`

### **Option 3 (Via Kali):**

If you really want to do things the easy way, you can use apt in Kali Linux to download SecLists.

`sudo apt install seclists`

### Note: 

I believe that using apt will default SecLists to usr/share/seclists. 
<br>If you wanted SecLists in /usr/share/wordlists/seclists then you would need to move the directory. 

### 6. **Summary**

SecLists is a great companion to any web fuzzing, directory discovery, username and password discovery, or other tools that use wordlists. 

I highly suggest you keep SecLists as one of the wordlists you reference regularly for discovery. 

I hope you enjoyed this blog post.
