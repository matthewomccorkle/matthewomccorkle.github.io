### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **seventeenth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Find **Hashid** [here](https://www.kali.org/tools/hashid/).

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Hashid tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is Hashid?**

Hashing is an algorithmic function that takes an input and outputs it as a string of a fixed length. Hash algorithms are used for verification of integrity of a file, password, or any input. Sometimes software developers show you the hash output of their downloaded file so you can compare your hash of your download to the original hash of the file from the developer. This ensures that the file has not changed during the download. 

Hashid, formerly hash-identifier was created to quickly identify hashed values to their hash algorithm.

### 4. **Why use Hashid?**

During penetration testing an analyst may find a file containing passwords that have been hashed. It would be extremely difficult for an analyst to memorize all of the hashing algorithm qualities of identification, instead using a program like Hashid allows quick identification of hash algorithms.

Identifying the algorithm allows the analyst to run tools that compare the hashed value to pre-computer tables (called rainbow tables)  of hashed passwords.

A hash cannot be reversed however, by computing the hash values of every password in a file like rockyou.txt you can quickly compare your found passwords to the rockyou.txt passwords.

Don't know what rockyou.txt is? Check out the story [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt).


### 5. **How to use Hashid?**

You need a hash value to search. I am using the hash values from [this](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) table for the Hashcat tool (more about that tool another time).

In the examples below I used the following hashes:

$DCC2$10240#tom#e4e938d12fe5974dc42a90120bd9c90f

127e6fbfe24a750e72930c220a8e138275656b8e5d8f48a98c3c92df2caba935

    Step 1:
    Using hashid is very simple. To see the help menu type:

    hashid -h

    Step 2:
