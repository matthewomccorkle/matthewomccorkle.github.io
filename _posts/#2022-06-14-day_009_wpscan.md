### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the ninth blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it.

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the WpScan tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

Additionally, to host a vulnerable Wordpress site I used the Try Hack Me room "Wordpress: CVE-2021-29447". I am a daily learner on the Try Hack Me platform and remembered completing this room in the past, so I figured it would be an easy example site to use WpScan on. You can find the room [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/wordpresscve202129447).

### 3. **What is WpScan?**

WpScan is a command line tool which scans WordPress sites for security vulnerabilities. 

Find more information about WpScan [here](https://WpScan.com/wordpress-security-scanner).

WpScan GitHub [here](https://github.com/WpScanteam/WpScan).

### 4. **Why use WpScan?**

You can find common Linux commands and their typical use using WpScan `command`.

---

### 5. **How to use WpScan?**

    Step 1: 
    You can simply navigate to the WpScan website which is "WpScan" and use 
    the tool in a web browser. However, if you want to install WpScan to the 
    command line continue to step 2.

    Step 2:

To install WpScan to the terminal I am going to use the WpScan GitHub and instructions located: [here](https://github.com/chubin/WpScan#installation).

    Step 3:
    I am going to install WpScan globally so I will use the provided command 
    from the installation portion of the GitHub:

    curl -s https://cht.sh/:cht.sh | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/cht.sh && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cht.sh

<br>

If all went well with the curl transfer and permission change then you should be able to use cht.sh commands immediately.

**Note** WpScan is the website. `cht.sht` is the command in your terminal. 

    Step 4:
    Let's try out the cht.sh command, type the following in your terminal window:
    cht.sh chown

    You should see a display showing the chown command its common uses.

**Congratulations** on installing WpScan as a command cht.sh directly to your terminal! While this may not replace your manual pages, it certainly gives a quick and concise reference page for commands. 

    Step 5 (bonus):
    Let's give cht.sh an alias so we do not have to type cht.sh <command> every time.

    Enter this command in your terminal to determine which shell you are using:

    echo "$SHELL"

    Note the output, mine says "usr/bin/zsh"

<br>

    Step 6 (bonus):
    In your home directory type the following command:

    ls -la

    This should list out all files and hidden files. 

    I am looking for the file .zshrc while you may be looking for the file .bashrc

<br>

    Step 7 (bonus):
    The .zshrc or .bashrc file contains variables, aliases, functions and other settings that are used in every terminal you open. 

    I want to make the command cht.sh become cht so I do not have to type the .sh every time. 

    So I run the command:

    sudo nano .zshrc

    Scroll down to the alias section (hint: you can use page up / down) 
    and add the alias:

    alias cht='cht.sh' 

    to save and exit:

    Ctrl + X -> 
    y -> 
    <enter>

<br>

    Step 8:
    Open a new terminal window.

<br>

    Step 9:
    Test your alias:
    
    cht ls

<br>

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what WpScan is, and some of its capabilities.

WpScan and its terminal tool cht.sh is a simple cheat sheet reference tool for commands.

This tool does not replace the official manual pages but does offer a quicker and easier reference for common command use.
