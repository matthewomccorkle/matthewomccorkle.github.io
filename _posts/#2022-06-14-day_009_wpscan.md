### 2. **My Setup**

For running the WpScan tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

Additionally, to host a vulnerable Wordpress site I used the Try Hack Me room "Wordpress: CVE-2021-29447". I am a daily learner on the Try Hack Me platform and remembered completing this room in the past, so I figured it would be an easy example site to use WpScan on. You can find the room [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/wordpresscve202129447).
