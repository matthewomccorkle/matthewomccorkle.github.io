## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Nessus* accomplishes and how to use it.

### 1. **Introduction**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/Nessus/Nessus1.png)

Welcome to the fifth blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

You can install Nessus Essentials on virtually any available device. 

You probably would not want to install Nessus on a cellphone as that would limit it's capabilities.

See the screenshot below of just some of the Operating Systems and distributions Nessus runs on.

### 3. **What is Nessus?**

"Nessus is a wireless network and device detector, sniffer, wardriving tool, and WIDS (wireless intrusion detection) framework." - Nessus [website](https://www.Nessuswireless.net/).

Basically, Nessus allows you to see and analyze wireless networks around you.<br>
Also, Nessus can act as an intrusion detection device to increase security on your network. See more on that [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/wireless-security-using-raspberry-pi-4-Nessus-and-python/).

Find Nessus at the creator's GitHub [here](https://github.com/Nessuswireless/Nessus) or their website [here](https://www.Nessuswireless.net/).

### 4. **Why use Nessus?**

For personal use:

- Determine what networks are around you to determine the best channel to set your WiFi access point.

- Determine if rogue or malicious devices are around you.

For professional use:

- Penetration testing on approved infrastructure.

- Determine if hidden devices have been set up in your area of operation.

- Wireless intrusion detection service.

There are many uses for Nessus, more uses than I can go over in this concise and simple blog post.

If you are interested in WiFi management and information I suggest you look more into the uses Nessus offers.

**Please only use Nessus for testing and understanding wireless networks you have explicit legal access to.**

### 5. **How to use Nessus?**

**Kali or ParrotOS**
    
    Step 1: 
    You need to ensure your wireless card is in monitor mode.
    Run the following command in your terminal window:

    sudo iw dev

    This command gives you an output of your wireless devices and their name.
    Below you will see that my card ID is wlan0 and in managed mode. 
    Note the ID of your card.

    Step 2:
    Place your wireless card in monitor mode, using the ID of your card found in Step 1.
    
    Run the following commands:

    sudo ip link set wlan0 down
    sudo iw wlan0 set monitor none
    sudo ip link set wlan0 up

<br>

    Step 3:
    Finally, verify your card is in monitor mode by running step 1:

    sudo iw dev

<br>

    Step 4:
    On Kali and ParrotOS Nessus comes installed and the service has its own group ID.
    Therefore, we have to add our user to the group.

    sudo usermod -aG Nessus <username>

**You are finally ready to use Nessus!**

## <span style="color:red">***One More Time, Disclaimer***</span>:<br>
**Please only use Nessus for testing and understanding wireless networks you have explicit legal access to.**

    Step 5:
    In a terminal window run the following command to start Nessus.

    Nessus -c wlan0

<br>

    Step 6:
    The terminal points you to the web GUI for Nessus.

    http://localhost:2501

    Step 7:
    Navigate to the locally hosted website.

<br>

    Step 8:
    During this first visit, you will need to create a username and password. 

<br>

    Step 9:
    Once logged in you will see your wireless card capturing data about the networks around you.

    The name, SSID, Type, Security, Channels, etc. can be viewed from the main page.

**Congratulations, you now have Nessus up and running and finding networks!**

For security reasons, this is as far as I will go in the tutorial. <br>
In the future, I plan to make a Wireless Intrusion Detection Service using Nessus where I will go into more details!

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Nessus is, and some of its capabilities.

We briefly discussed how to set up and run Nessus. 

I suggest you play around with Nessus and find out information about your network and environment. 
Remember that actively targeting a wireless network or device that you do not have explicit permission is considered illegal in many jurisdictions.  

More resources can be found on the Nessus GitHub [here](https://github.com/Nessuswireless/Nessus).<br>
