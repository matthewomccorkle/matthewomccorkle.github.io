## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Cupp* accomplishes and how to use it.

---

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the second blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. My Setup

For running the Cupp tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment. 

---

### 3. What is Cupp?

Cupp is a wordlist generator which creates password lists used in dictionary password attacks.

The greatest part of Cupp is that the python script asks the user to input various bits of personal information about the person they are trying to create a password list for. 

Additionally, Cupp allows the operator to input keywords that are also used to generate potential passwords.

### 4. Why use Cupp?

To make a dictionary list of potential passwords. 

You would use this list with various penetration testing tools to then crack the password for access to a system, website, etc.

You can make customized word lists using personally identifiable data and keywords about your victim.

### 5. How to use Cupp?

**On Kali or Parrot OS**
    
    Step 1: 
    You may have to download and install Cupp. 
    If you are on Kali open your terminal and type:

    apt install cupp -y

**Hint**: use `sudo apt install cupp -y` if you are not root.
<br>

    Step 2:
    Run cupp in interactive mode in your terminal by typing:
    cupp -i

    Step 3: 
    Now that Cupp is running in interactive mode we can follow the prompts.
    Note: Cupp requires a First Name in interactive mode, 
    all other options can be left blank and skipped by hitting <enter>.
<br>

    Step 4: Fill out all of the prompts that you can to build a longer and more complex wordlist.

    My Example:

    Step 5: Let the scan run and once finished you should have results displayed of:
    -types of services found on the victim
    -scripts used and their results
    -information on the device and OS
    -CVEs that may be present
    -screenshots of any sites found
    -a tab for each script ran and it's results.

### 6. Summary

I covered a very brief and basic view of Legion from GoVanguard.<br> 
We discussed some of its uses, how to use it at a basic level and why to use it. <br>
This brief post barely touches the capabilities of Legion, so go check it out and try it out for yourself. More resources can be found on the GoVanguard GitHub [here](https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion) and from the GoVanguard website [here](https://govanguard.com/legion/).<br>

Thanks for reading!
