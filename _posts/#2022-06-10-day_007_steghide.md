## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Steghide* accomplishes and how to use it.

---

### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the seventh blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Steghide tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is Steghide?**

Steghide is a command line tool that allows a user to hide data or files inside of an image. 

Steganography is defined as:

"the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file" - [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography).

Find more information about Steghide [here](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/).

### 4. **Why use Steghide?**

From a malicious standpoint this is an excellent way to send malicious files or code to a victim.

Steganography is a fun way to send messages within other messages, files, or images.

Steganoggraphy in itself is insecure, so do not rely on this method of communication for secure passing of information. 

Please do not use this method to send malicious files or code to anyone.

### 5. **How to use Steghide?**

    Step 1: 
    Open your terminal in Kali linux.

    Ensure you have steghide installed by typing:
    man steghide

    This should show you the manual for steghide.
    Press q to exit the manual.

<br>

    Step 2:
    steghide is a simple tool, but does have peculiar commands that you can 
    reference in the manual.

    For this example we will need an image and a file to use steghide.

    I have chosen a .jpeg image of neopets called:
    neopetsnosteg.jpeg

    Use the ls command to check the file size:

    The file size is 305,222 bytes (298kb approx).

    The file size is important as that is the reference we will use after we 
    have added secret information to the image. 

<br>

See the picture "neopetsnosteg.jpeg" and a screenshot of the file size below.

    Step 3:
    We need to create a file to hide within the image. 
    I created a txt file named "neopetspriortosteghide.txt that containes the data: "Neopets are the best" using the following command:

    echo "Neopets are the best" > neopetspriortosteghide.txt

    use the ls command to check the file size:

    ls-l

    This text file is 21 bytes.

    Step 4:
    Combining the file "neopetspriortosteghide.txt" into neopetsnosteg.jpeg is easy.

    Run the following command in your terminal:

    steghide embed -ef neopetspriortosteghide.txt -cf neopetsnosteg.jpeg -sf neopetswithsteg.jpeg -p neopets

<br>

Congratulations, you have embeded the text file neopetsppriortosteghide.txt into the image neopetsnosteg.jpeg and output  the file as neopetswithsteg.jpeg and a passphrase of neopets.

You can verify the image has the embeded file by checking its size using ls -l.

    Step 5:
    Verify the file size of the output image neopetswithsteg.jpeg


### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Steghide is, and some of its capabilities.

Steghide is a quick and easy to use directory and object web scanner. 

Steghide does have some limitations, it uses a wordlist for finding directories and objects, as demonstrated when dvwa was not in the default world list, Steghide did not find it. 

Steghide should only be used on websites where you have permission to perform active reconnaisance. 

Go out there and scan your Hack The Box websites for directories!
