## This post is designed to teach you what the tool *Steghide* accomplishes and how to use it.

---

### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the seventh blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 
In this post and concurrent posts, I will introduce you to a tool in Kali or Parrot Linux. <br>
I will discuss use cases for the tool.<br> 
Finally, I will show a quick how-to to get you started using it. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Steghide tool, I used Kali Linux in a VmWare Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

---

### 3. **What is Steghide?**

Steghide is a command line tool that allows a user to hide data or files inside of an image. 

Steganography is defined as:

"the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file" - [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography).

Find more information about Steghide [here](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/).

### 4. **Why use Steghide?**

From a malicious standpoint this is an excellent way to send malicious files or code to a victim.

Steganography is a fun way to send messages within other messages, files, or images.

Steganoggraphy in itself is insecure, so do not rely on this method of communication for secure passing of information. 

Please do not use this method to send malicious files or code to anyone.

### 5. **How to use Steghide?**

    Step 1: 
    Open your terminal in Kali linux.

    Ensure you have steghide installed by typing:
    man steghide

    This should show you the manual for steghide.
    Press q to exit the manual.

<br>

    Step 2:
    steghide is a simple tool, but does have peculiar commands that you can 
    reference in the manual.

    For this example we will need an image and a file to use steghide.

    I have chosen a .jpeg image of neopets called:
    neopetsnosteg.jpeg

    The file size is 305,222 bytes.

    The file size is important as that is the reference we will use after we 
    have added secret information to the image. 
<br>

See the picture "neopetsnosteg.jpeg" and a screenshot of the file size below.

![]()


    Step 3:
Here is a breakdown of the above command:

I skipped recursive scanning as I just wanted to get top level directories and objects. You can choose to scan as you wish.

After scanning is completed, my terminal has a standard output that lists all objects and directories that Steghide found during its scan. Again this is limited to the dictionary list used (I used the default common.txt that Steghide uses). <br>
See my output below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/9351c5a33650d3c803dc027d0e80ff6db4b6d78b/_posts/assets/100%20tools/Steghide/Steghide2.png)

    Step 3 (bonus):
    If you have used the Metasploitable2 server you know that it comes with the 
    "Damn-vulnerable-Web-Application" - DVWA. The DVWA is a directory that was 
    not found by Steghide. So I am going to add that search parameter to my Steghide 
    default wordlist located at:

    /usr/share/wordlists/Steghide/common.txt

    You may need root permission to alter this file. 
    I added dvwa to the top of the file.

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewomccorkle/matthewomccorkle.github.io/master/_posts/assets/100%20tools/Steghide/Steghide3.png)

Now you can see from my screenshot below the directory dvwa was found immediately.

    Step 4 (bonus):
    If you wanted to switch the wordlist Steghide uses you can add the complete file 
    path to the dictionary file, to the command immediately following the URL:

    Steghide http://192.168.175.128 /usr/share/wordlists/notdefault/wordlist.txt -o 
    metasploitable2.txt -N 404 -r 

    

### 6. **Summary**

This blog post showed you a very brief overview of what Steghide is, and some of its capabilities.

Steghide is a quick and easy to use directory and object web scanner. 

Steghide does have some limitations, it uses a wordlist for finding directories and objects, as demonstrated when dvwa was not in the default world list, Steghide did not find it. 

Steghide should only be used on websites where you have permission to perform active reconnaisance. 

Go out there and scan your Hack The Box websites for directories!
