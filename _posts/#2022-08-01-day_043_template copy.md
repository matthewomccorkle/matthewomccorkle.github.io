For running the pyWhat tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

I used the following PCAP files from Marcelle Lee for analysis:

### 3. **What is pyWhat?**

pyWhat is a discovery tool which analyzes input such as strings, files, GitHub repositories, and web pages and identifies information found as standard out.

### 4. **Why use pyWhat?**

pyWhat can help a security researcher perform a quick analysis on a PCAP file from a network scanner. 

Penetration testers may use pyWhat to find leaked data in GitHub repositories or websites of organizations they perform testing on. This is a tool that could be used in the OSINT phase of passive reconnaissance and in the active reconnaissance portion of testing.
