## This post is designed to introduce you to the tool Nmap.

### 1. **Introduction**

Welcome to the **thirteenth** blog post of 100 tools in 100 days.<br> 


Nmap was created in 1997 by Gordon Lyon. Now, 24 years later Gordon still maintains Nmap as well as a group of other security tools.

Find **Nmap** [here](https://nmap.org/).

Nmap can be downloaded for nearly all operating systems. If you want to use Nmap with a graphical user interface you can do so by installing ZenMap or downloading the tool from the nmap website above. 

---

### 2. **My Setup**

For running the Nmap tool, I used Kali Linux in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

For hosting a device to run Nmap against I used metasploitable2 in a VMware Workstation 16 Player virtualized environment.

### 3. **What is Nmap?**

Really the more important question here is "What isn't Nmap?" Once you dive deep into the Nmap tool you will see what i mean, it seems like it can do a great deal of things. 

Today I will cover the basic uses of Nmap such as:
Host discovery
Port scanning
Version detection
OS detection

In part 2 of a future Nmap blog post I will cover using Nmap to also perform interaction with hosts through the Nmap Scripting Engine.

I am seperating the basic use of Nmap from the expanded scripting engine as I feel these are two very different examples of how the tool can be used, making Nmap nearly 2 different tools. For transparency, I will discuss service versioning and operating system detection, both of which technically use the Nmap scripting engine.

### 4. **Why use Nmap?**

Nmap should be one of if not the first tool used when mapping a network. Nmap should be your primary networking tool as its capabilities apply to most devices and operating systems. 

Network mapping - Using Nmap you can scan for hosts on a range of IP addresses to determine which addresses are in use.

Port discovery on hosts - you can determine which ports are open on a host.

Version and Operating System discovery - a user can determine which version of software is running on a port, as well as determine which operating system the host is running. 

Note, most of the common Nmap scanning methods are easily detectable by IDS/IPS so do not scan on networks that you do not have explicit permission to scan.

### 5. **How to use Nmap?**

**Note:** most of the common Nmap scanning methods are easily detectable by IDS/IPS so do not scan on networks that you do not have explicit permission to scan. 

**Note:** I am performing multiple Nmap scans, in a penetration testing environment this is not the correct way of network enumeration as you are contacting the hosts and network multiple times, therefore this is not a representation of accurate penetration testing methods. 

**Note:** You can use these methods on many of the TryHackMe rooms and Hack The Box machines!


    Step 1:
    I am using the command line interface version of Nmap and will therefore 
    cover command line interaction only in this blog post.

    Open a terminal window, and type:

    nmap --help

    This will bring up the basic help page for Nmap.

You can also find cheat sheets for Nmap all over the internet which make using Nmap even easier.

I have found this cheatsheet a great starting point:<br>
[https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nmap-Cheat-Sheet.pdf](https://cdn.comparitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nmap-Cheat-Sheet.pdf)

    Step 2:
    I want to scan my network to find the Metasploitable2 host computer.
    I will use the below command to scan for hosts and open ports.

    nmap <ipaddress/cidr>

    or

    nmap 192.168.175.0/24

<br>

Notice below, the default simplest scan using Nmap found the Metasploitable2 host and the ports / services running.

    Step 2a:
    If you wanted to perform a host only discovery you could tell Nmap to do a ping scan on the entire network using the following command:

    nmap 192.168.175.0/24 -sP

<br>

![]()

    Step 3:
    Now I want to know what versions of the services are running on each 
    port. Additionally, I am going to scan only the metasploitable2 machine 
    moving forward.

    I run the nmap command with an added option.

    nmap 192.168.175.128 -sV

    The "-sV" option allows nmap to detect the version of the service on each port.

    Step 4:
    My next step in network enumeration is determing which operating system 
    is running on the Metasploitable2 host using the command:

    nmap 192.168.175.128 -sV -O

    The "-O" option allows nmap to detect the operating system details.
